I don't remember one moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said
Now I'm closer to the edge
It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no
Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free
The birth of a song, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge
This never ending story, paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory, lost in ourselves
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I will never forget
No, no
I will never regret
No, no
I willâ€¦
